## Introduction

Gram is the Laravel template with TailwindCSS as default preset and ships with some features like
Passport, Socialite, and some debugging tools. Gram used for (nearly) all our projects, but you
may use our template but please notice that we offer no support whatsoever. We also don't follow
semver for this project and won't guarantee that the code (especially the master branch) is stable.
In short: when using this, you're on your own.

## Quick Start

At least you will need `PHP >= 7.2` and `Nodejs >= 8.15`. For database backend, you can choose between
`PostgreSQL >= 9.6` or `MySQL >= 5.7` or `MariaDB >= 10.3` or any other database engine that supported
by Laravel. Also, you maybe want to use `Redis >= 3.2` for session store and or caching storage.

### Create New Project

```
composer create-project presethub/laravel-base <app_name>
```

Or, if you want to use spesific version:

```
composer create-project presethub/laravel-base <app_name> <version>
```

Change `<app_name>` with your own and `<version>` with release version.
See [release page][releasepage] for the version number.


#### Package Version

The versioning number will follow the release of the Laravel version, followed by the package version release number:

```
a.b.c  =>  a.b are Laravel version, c is package version.
5.8.1  =>  Laravel 5.8 and 1 is release number / revision.
```

### Local Installation

Edit or create `.env` file and then execute:

```bash
composer install
npm i --no-optional
npm run development

php artisan web-tinker:install
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
php artisan passport:install
```

### Automatic Versioning

Edit `config/version.yml` file and change the remote git repository value with your own.
You will need add git hooks, open `.git/hooks/post-commit` and put this code:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
php artisan version:refresh
```
